	  		<p>Language brings with it an identity and culture or at least a perception of it. Even the slightest difference in language can correspond with biased beliefs of the speakers. Saying “girls can be as good as boys in math”, brings it a sexist stereotype. Grammatically it implies that being good in  math is more common/natural to boys than it is to girls. Language can change how we perceive the world or people unknowingly. In the book “Born A Crime” by Trevor Noah,A shared language meant a shared identity to the South Africans,a different language communicated “We’re different”.The architectures of apartheid understood this .Part of the effort to divide black people was to make them feel they’re different not just physically but by language as well. And because of this they fell into the trap that the “white man” had set for them and they fought against each other thinking they were different. The great thing about language is you can use it to do the opposite and convince people that they’re the same. The fact that someone doesn’t speak like you can reinforce a racist perception,a great scientist can speak in broken English ad the first thing that clicks is “he/she is not intelligent”.However if a person doesn’t look like you but speaks like you,your brain short circuits,your mind says if “he doesn’t look like me he isn’t like me,”but the language code says “If he speaks like me he is like me.”</p>

  		<p>Freedom is the ability to act,think or speak as one wants. Trevor,the author of the book “Born A Crime”,went to the toilet to shit but it was pouring down rain,the thought of going out and getting drenched,the leaking ceiling,wet newspapers and the flies attacking from below restrained him. Freedom is the ability to do things without being prevented by other factors. There’s so much outside here in the real world that prevents us from growing,the “flies” won’t let us settle properly in our space,you go outside and it’s raining “a lot of negative energy”,but his urge for freedom was more than the weight of the consequences,what could be worse?He chose to shit on a newspaper on the floor. When he started he was “not fully at the experience yet”.When you get out of your comfort zone it’s not easy at first,but the moment you try you get into it,when you. reach at “the moment” that is when it gets really nice. There’s a sense of humility that comes with it regardless of who you are,when we “shit” we forget our “airs” and “graces”,we forget how rich or famous we are. All that goes away. You are never more yourself than when you are free. Nobody should be robbed of this.</p>

     <p>Let’s talk about less personal,more agreeable things. “I don’t want to talk about religion. People will end up fighting”.Most of you have probably had this phrase. It's much easier to steer clear from the topic and talk about less personal things. South Africans had a different view of religion,For Trevor’s mum,Religion was an essential source of solace and meaning. As he notes, “many other colonized people around the world;it allows them to sustain hope in the face of their extraordinary oppression but also lets them concretely advance colonial society by following colonizers’ customs. Noah’s mum is a devoted christian,she takes the family to three churches every Sunday.
    Religion has also been used as a tool of division,whites had their own church,black had their own church and mixed color had theirs too and each offered different things to Trevor’s mum. It was used by the oppressors to make them feel better about the distress they felt from being poor and exploited. The white man was quite stern with the native. “You need to pray to Jesus,Jesus will save you.”</p>

		<p>This is the ability to recover quickly from difficulty or toughness. Our ability to spring back honorably from what feels or looks or is a setback is what defines us and sets us apart from wild animals. The people of Soweto,in as much as it felt like a prison designed by their oppressors,Soweto gave them a sense of self-determination and control. It was theirs. They owned it. To them it had an inspirational quality that you could not find elsewhere. In any formal setup the dream would be to come out of the ghetto,but to them because they couldn’t leave,they strived to transform it. Despite the lack of basic social amenities,no paved roads and electricity,they made life for themselves. A black market economy sprung,businesses thrived. They didn’t have money but still worked so hard to build their houses,brick walls. Resilience and hope go together,the people of Soweto went to an extent of building driveways in their compounds and they never had cars,they hoped that one day the driveway would be useful How well can you adapt to life?Why do others seem to get out of difficult situations quickly?Why do others get stuck?Everybody has resilience,it is just a matter of how well you put it to good use in your life.</p>
